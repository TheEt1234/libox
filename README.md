# Libox

A minetest sandboxing library, offering a basic environment, utilities, normal sandbox and a "coroutine" sandbox

Everything is avaliable in the async environment except the coroutine sandbox (due to minetest limitations)

See [api.md](https://github.com/TheEt1234/libox/blob/master/api.md) for documentation and definitions

See [env_docs.md](https://github.com/TheEt1234/libox/blob/master/env_docs.md) for documentation of the sandbox environment
